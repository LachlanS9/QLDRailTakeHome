To Cynthia Mackenzie,

I just wanted to say thank you for considering me for this role.

I have completed the task and added a little menu feature as well. If you have any test cases you want to run through, you can either upload the .txt file into the upload folder or add it into test data. I worked on the given assumptions so I wrote my code to assume the format of the txt file looks like:

Central, True 

Roma St, False 

South Brisbane, False

Thanks again for your consideration!

Lachlan
